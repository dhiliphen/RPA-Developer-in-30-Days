Showing pain, showing betrayal, showing subjugation to the motherland, but not even batting an eyelid at the oppressor. Not just showing all these emotions, but showing all these emotions in one shot, in one frame. That is like an epic.”[44]  Upcoming projects Rama Rao is reuniting with Koratala Siva, after Janatha Garage, for his 30th film, Devara, which went on floors in March 2023 after enormous delays.[45] It is scheduled for a theatrical release on 5 April 2024.
